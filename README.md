# Insta-Fista Social Application

This is a full-featured Insta-Fista built using the MERN stack (MongoDB, Express.js, React.js, Node.js), with Redux for state management, ShadCN UI for modern styling, and Socket.io for real-time features. The application replicates core Instagram functionalities such as user profiles, posts, comments, likes, followers, and real-time notifications.
